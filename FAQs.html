       <h1 class="pp">FAQ</h1>
       <div class="faq">
       <h2 class="ppagain">Is it really necessary to bring my dog and/or cat in for a yearly comprehensive exam?</h2>
       
Comprehensive examinations are recommended AT LEAST annually to check for health issues that may not be apparent to owners. During a comprehensive examination the veterinarian will examine your pet's eyes, ears, skin and hair coat, listen to their heart, and discuss any concerns you may have. 
       
       
       <h2 class="ppagain">Does heartworm prevention and flea prevention need to be given year round?</h2>
       
Yes! Mosquitos and fleas are both present year round across the United States, but especially in the Gulf Coast region where temperatures remain warm for much of the year. Heartworm incidence in this region is still very high making year round heartworm prevention paramount.
       
       
       <h2 class="ppagain">What dog and cat food brands do you recommend?</h2>
       
There are many great brands out there. The ones we recommend the most based on years of results and healthy dogs and cats. It is recommended that pets are fed premium diets like Purina, Science Diet, Iams and Eukanuba. Occasionally, prescription diets are recommended based on a pet's specific needs. Our Veterinarians will make these recommendations when appropriate.
       
       
       <h2 class="ppagain">When do I switch from puppy/kitten food to adult food?</h2>
       
Switching a puppy or kitten to adult food too early can cause obesity and gastro-intestinal issues. We recommend switching to adult dog or cat food between 10-12 months.
How often do I need to bathe my dog?
       
If no skin condition is present, you can bathe your dog every 4-6 weeks.


       <h2 class="ppagain">What can I do to keep my hamster energized during the winter?</h2>
       
Many animals have an instinct telling them when it's time to go into hibernation. Hamsters also tend to hibernate when it gets colder, although this does not apply to all hamsters; generally only when it gets colder than 10â„ƒ.

       <h2 class="ppagain">How can I ensure my guinea pig gets enough vitamin C?</h2>
       
Just like us, Guinea Pigs do not make vitamin C by themselves. Therefore, they need some help in getting this vitamin. As a result, Beaphar developed several products suitable to give to your guinea pig.
